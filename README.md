This task focuses on a dataset from a bank, containing information about various clients and their financial attributes. The dataset includes 17 columns and 11,162 entries, capturing a diverse range of information such as age, job, marital status, education, and financial details like balance and loan status. The target variable, 'deposit', indicates whether a client has subscribed to a term deposit.

1. Data preprocessing involved handling categorical and numerical features, ensuring data quality, and managing outliers. Categorical data were encoded, and numerical data were scaled to prepare for machine learning models.

2. Exploratory data analysis was conducted using visualizations such as histograms and box plots to understand the distribution of data and identify any patterns or anomalies. A correlation matrix was created to examine relationships between numerical features, highlighting highly correlated variables for further analysis.

3. Machine learning models, including Decision Tree Classifiers, were trained and evaluated to predict the likelihood of a client subscribing to a term deposit. The models were assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with visualizations of decision trees provided to illustrate the decision-making process.

This comprehensive analysis aims to provide insights into customer behavior and support strategic decision-making for targeting potential customers effectively.
